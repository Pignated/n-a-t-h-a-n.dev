                    <h2>My Homelab</h2>
                    <p>Over the past few months, I've been working on a homelab. It started when a coworker of mine gifted me an old 
                        8 port gigabit switch, specifically the Netgear GS108. After playing with that and a couple raspberry pis I have, I also bought a wired router,
                        an Omada ER605, turning my old router into a wireless access point. I used the built in vpn option on the router to remotely access my set up, using OpenVPN
                        initially, but I had some issues with it working consistently. For one, I had to manually disable it when I was at my apartment or else I wouldn't have
                        any internet access. I was able to write a script to help with this, but it still also had consistency issues when remotely accessing my network. I tried using one of
                        raspberry pis as the VPN server instead of the router itself and this didn't make the situation much better. I decided to switch from OpenVPN to Wireguard.

                        I had much less trouble using Wireguard, and found it's cli much easier to use. I had also set up a Pihole on one of my raspberry pis. Pihole is a local DNS server
                        used to filter certain traffic, usually ads and trackers, stopping it from being resolved and passing the rest of the DNS requests to a public DNS server (personally
                        I use OpenDNS with Google's DNS servers as backup). I have spent many an evening just watching my traffic, scanning for anything weird that I might want to block.

                        I thought I had reached a near peek of what I would have for a while as far as a my homelab goes. These things cost money and I'm on a student budget. I started looking
                        into running a minecraft server off of an old laptop, using a different domain I own to use it so my friends or whoever joined it wouldn't have to type in my whole IP, but I had
                        an issue: running a minecraft server on the regular minecraft port (25565) was often risky, as there are many bots that check for open minecraft ports to grief worlds.
                        I did have my server set to whitelist so I could control who can join, but I still preferred to use a different port, without people having to type the port when saving the server.
                        I couldn't figure out how to make it work until I found out about SRV dns records. Using this, I could specify what port a service should use (in this case minecraft) when trying to
                        use a specific subdomain. This was perfect for me, and would help with an idea I eventually wanted to use, a web server which can dynamically start and stop multiple minecraft servers
                        for me and my friends. I was estatic at this find, but it wouldn't be the last massive change to my setup.

                        That would come when another coworker of mine donated an old server we had used for imaging laptops. A Cisco UCS C220 M3, a server first sold in 2012 (unless google is lying to me). This was 
                        a game changer for me. I'd never had that much raw power before, and I was and am very excited to see what I can do with it. It wasn't in perfect condition, have the drive bays aren't showing up,
                        and it has an orange error light that I cannot for the life of me figure out the reason for, but that just means more space for me to learn.
                        I think the issue with the drives not all showing up is the built in drive controller, and might be solved by getting an external SAS controller that fits in one of the onboard PCIe slots.
                        I will update after I give it a shot. Regardless of it's condition, I immediately go to work setting up the device. I installed Proxmox as the OS so I could run many VMs and/or containers and
                        use them how I see fit. At the moment I use Debian as the OS of the VMs as from my limited research it was supposed to be good for servers. THe first VM I set up, named "NetworkShizz", holds a pihole and
                        a wireguard VPN, with my raspberry pis now working as back ups in case the server goes down. I created an image of the debian install (after adding a couple essentials and putting in my ssh key) to be used
                        as a template so I don't have to go through the whole setup of Debian again every time I want to start up a new VM(it took me a little too long to figure out that was a good idea). The next VM I built was 
                        made for hosting websites, specifically this one. So far I have also made one with a minecraft server, but I haven't used said server too much as of yet. I look forward to more ideas on what to use my server for
                        and welcome any suggestions to my email (npcobb2003@gmail.com).
