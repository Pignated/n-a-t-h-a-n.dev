                    <h2>My Homelab</h2>
                    <p>Over the past few months, I have been developing a homelab to practice my programming, networking, and IT skills. I have throughly enjoyed
                        the process of building up systems which I can use to make my life a little easier and a little more fun. Self-hosting has been my main focus
                        with the homelab, but I do plan to get into more experimental endevours as I continue. The following is a list of what I am using in my setup.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="homelab_header">Hardware</h2>
                    <hr class="homelab_header">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Currently my setup consists of an Omada ER605 router, a Netgear GS108 gigabit switch, two Raspberry Pis, and two enterprise servers, a Cisco UCS C220 M3
                        and a Dell Poweredge R720, which are in Proxmox cluster. More or less everything else in my setup is running off one of these. The Dell is newer, faster, and
                        quieter, however I don't have much storage on it. Eventually I want to move all of my services on there, but currently things which need larger amounts of storage
                        space stay on my Cisco machine. I am eventually going to flash the raid controller on the Dell to work in a JBOD configuration, and get a couple of higher capacity
                        SAS drives so that I can really make good use of the storage and Proxmox's software raid. I am thinking I will likely retire the Cisco machine after that, at least
                        until I can store it somewhere where the noise it makes isn't bothersome to me. 
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="homelab_header">VPN</h2>
                    <hr class="homelab_header">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I originally used the built-in OpenVPN configuration in my router, I have since switched to using Wireguard, with the server running
                        on my R720. The convenience of being able to access and modify my set up from anywhere was one of the biggest things I wanted when starting
                        my homelab. As a student I am seldom actually at my apartment, so being able to do my work from anywhere is very useful.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="homelab_header">Media Backup</h2>
                    <hr class="homelab_header">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For media backup I have created a NextCloud server on a container where I store my pictures. I plan to add my family to the 
                        server so we can create shared albums and
                        the like, but I keep forgetting to set it up when I see them. I also keep backups of my schoolwork and personal projects (although my projects tend to be on 
                        Github), but this is just on an ssd connected to a to a Raspberry Pi.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="homelab_header">Pi-hole</h2>
                    <hr class="homelab_header">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Originally run on one of my Raspberry Pis, I now run a Pi-hole on one of the containers on my server. While predominately for blocking trackers and ads, I have also used
                        it to assign my devices local addresses that the Pi-hole can resolve as them for ease of access (rasp1.domain.com is a lot easier to remember than an IP address). 
                        On a side note, I do find it pretty entertaining to watch the traffic going through the Pi-hole and blocking any traffic that appears to be tracking or advertisements.
                        A Pi-hole isn't perfect, some websites like Youtube are getting smart, sending ad traffic and content through the same urls so that it can't be blocked, but it's 
                        pretty convenient.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="homelab_header">Webserver</h2>
                    <hr class="homelab_header">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To run this website, and possibly any others, I am currently using nginx for a reverse proxy, and then ExpressJS to serve the content of the website. This isn't my
                        long term plan, but I started putting this website on applications so I needed something. Eventually, I plan to switch to a Rust-based webserver, as I generally prefer
                        Rust over Javascript. The website is just vanilla html, css, and js, but eventually I also plan to switch to a framework (possibly React, but I haven't 100% decided yet).
