                    <h2>Welcome to my Webpage!</h2>
                    <p style="margin:10px">This is the <i>official</i> Nathan Cobb website, used to display my previous work, my personal and/or school projects,
                    and whatever else I decide to put on here. Here on the homepage I'll go over short descriptions of projects and work I've done in the past,
                    and lay out whatever other categories I've decided to add as the website goes on. This is very much a work in progress, but I am pretty happy
                    it. As you will see, I am by no means a web designer, but I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the type of projects where I do demonstrate
                    competency.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Info About the Site</h2>
                    <p style="margin:10px">This site is (currently) a static html page being served by ExpressJS. Eventually I want to switch to a rust-based web server
                    like Axum or Actix, but I wanted to get something started up quick. The web server is hosted on a Debian Container mangaged by Proxmox. All of this is run
                    on a Dell PowerEdge R720. I use nginx as a reverse proxy to access the web server and handle traffic for other systems of mine.
                    Along with eventually switching from expressjs to a rust web server, I do also want to switch from static html to react or something similar
                    for the frontend. <u></u>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p style="margin:10px">I am a Senior at the Milwaukee School of Engineering in downtown Milwaukee. I am currently on track to graduate after the Fall
                    Semester of the 2026-2027 academic year. I originally came to MSOE to study actuarial science, but after realizing all my favorite classes were the
                    ones where I got to program, I switched to a computer science major. I was able to make this switch only a year and a half in, so it only added an
                    extra semester on to my time at MSOE. Since I came to MSOE I've been on our IT Helpdesk Team, where I currently am a Tier 3 Technician and an Asset
                    Management Specialist. Most of what I do includes helping newer employees to find solutions to customer problems and imaging laptops with a managed
                    image of Windows 11.</p>
                    <p style="margin:10px">While my work is mostly with windows devices, I personally daily drive a laptop with NixOS installed on it. While the learning
                    curve has been quite steep, and there is still more I would like to figure out, I am very happy with my decision to switch to NixOS from Linux Mint,
                    partially for the cleaner feeling environment and partially for the computer nerd street cred it gets me. I do still have it dual-booted with Linux Mint
                    for those few times I do need some feature that I can't find with nix (although the amount of stuff missing from nix <i>is</i> less than you'd think it would be).
                    I do want to learn how to package things to make them nix compatible (especially the build tool for Flipper Zero apps, which includes its own internal python binary
                    despite the fact that it is installed using pip, presumably only to torment me), but I have yet to tame that particular beast.</p>
                    <p style="margin:10px">If you were to ask what I was most passionate about, I'd probably say computers. I very much enjoy working with them and being able to use
                    them in fun ways. Creating things is what I like to do, and programming is the best way I know how to do it. Now is a TCP socket wrapper that establishes a secure
                    connection and encrypts data between the client and server automatically going to impress as many people as some fancy gui project? No. But also I hate writing gui
                    code (hence the reason this website looks like this), so whatever who cares. I had a lot of fun making it. And I got to use rust (also partially for computer nerd
                    street cred), so that was fun. </p>
