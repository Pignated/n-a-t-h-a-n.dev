                    <p style="margin:10px">This is the <i>official</i> Nathan Cobb website, used to display my previous work, my personal and/or school projects,
                    and whatever else I decide to put on here. Here on the homepage I'll go over short descriptions of projects and work I've done in the past,
                    and lay out whatever other categories I've decided to add as the website goes on. This is very much a work in progress, but I am pretty happy
                    it. As you will see, I am by no means a web designer, but I cannot think of a better way to demonstrate the type of projects where I do demonstrate
                    competency.

                        like axum or actix, but I wanted to get something started up quick. The
